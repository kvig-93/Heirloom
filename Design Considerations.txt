To design the data model, we have to consider the following:

1. Data Relationships: Maintain clear relationships between experiments, processes, samples, analyses, equipment, and instruments.
2. Flexibility: Support multiple process types, analyses, and calibration requirements.
3. Scalability: Allow for additional experiments, processes, and instruments as the research grows.
4. Consistency: Use relational database principles to enforce integrity and prevent duplication.
5. Assumptions:
   * The database will use PostgreSQL for its relational features and support for structured and unstructured data.
   * Each piece of equipment and instrument has a unique identifier.
   * Calibration records include timestamps and are tied to specific instruments.
