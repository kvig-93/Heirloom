# Design Considerations

To design the data model, we have to consider the following:

1. Data Relationships: Maintain clear relationships between experiments, processes, samples, analyses, equipment, and instruments.
2. Flexibility: Support multiple process types, analyses, and calibration requirements.
3. Scalability: Allow for additional experiments, processes, and instruments as the research grows.
4. Consistency: Use relational database principles to enforce integrity and prevent duplication.
5. Assumptions:
   * The target database to be used in here will be in Snowflake for scalability, performance and SQL native platform         with flexibility to connect to various applications and run Python notebooks for Machine Learning. 
   * Each piece of equipment and instrument has a unique identifier.
   * Calibration records include timestamps and are tied to specific instruments.
