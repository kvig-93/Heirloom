# Design Considerations

To design the data model, we have to consider the following:

1. Data Relationships: Maintain clear relationships between experiments, processes, samples, analyses, equipment, and instruments.
 
2. Flexibility: Support multiple process types, analyses, and calibration requirements.
 
3. Scalability: Allow for additional experiments, processes, and instruments as the research grows.
 
4. Consistency: Use relational database principles to enforce integrity and prevent duplication.
   
5. Assumptions for target database:
   
 * Each experiment consists of multiple processes, which may vary in type and number.
 * Processes have distinct inputs and outputs.
 * Samples are collected during processes and undergo various analyses.
 * Instruments need regular calibration and can perform multiple types of analyses.
 * Each piece of equipment and instrument has a unique identifier.
 * Calibration records include timestamps and are tied to specific instruments.
